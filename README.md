Barebones Website

Files included:

- index.html — main HTML file with header, hero, feature sections, contact form, and footer
- styles.css — minimal styling and a dark theme toggle
- script.js — small vanilla JS (theme toggle, smooth scrolling, form stub)

How to use:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use "Open File").
2. Toggle the theme with the moon/sun button in the header. Theme preference is saved to localStorage.
3. Edit the files to customize content, styles, and form handling.

Notes:
- This is intentionally minimal. No build step required.
- For deployment, serve the files from any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
